#To Do List

* AJAX for adding team/schedule
* Front end for public viewing
 * Maybe just make the admin site a public site, with some sort of authentication in front of it.
* Implement bootstrap for formatting
* Move all API functions into their own subdir/index.php
* Tokenize the API calls
* User authentication. Perhaps look into codeignitor or another php framework
